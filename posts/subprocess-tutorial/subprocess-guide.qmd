# Introduction

The `subprocess` module in Python allows you to spawn new processes, connect to their input/output/error pipes, and obtain their return codes. It is a powerful interface for running external commands and interacting with them in a Pythonic way.

# Basic Usage

The most common way to use `subprocess` is by calling `subprocess.run()`. Here's a simple example:

```python
import subprocess

# Run a simple command
result = subprocess.run(["echo", "Hello from subprocess"], capture_output=True, text=True)
print(result.stdout)
```

This will output:

```
Hello from subprocess
```

# Capturing Output

You can capture both standard output and standard error using `capture_output=True`:

```python
result = subprocess.run(["ls", "non_existent_file"], capture_output=True, text=True)
print("STDOUT:", result.stdout)
print("STDERR:", result.stderr)
```

# Error Handling

Use `check=True` to raise an exception if the command fails:

```python
try:
    subprocess.run(["ls", "non_existent_file"], check=True)
except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
    print(f"Command failed with exit code {e.returncode}")
```

# Using Shell Commands

If you need to run a shell command as a string, use `shell=True`. Be careful with this as it can be a security hazard when using untrusted input.

```python
subprocess.run("echo Hello from shell", shell=True)
```

# Piping Commands

You can simulate piping like `ls | grep py` using `subprocess.Popen`:

```python
p1 = subprocess.Popen(["ls"], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
p2 = subprocess.Popen(["grep", "py"], stdin=p1.stdout, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
p1.stdout.close()
output = p2.communicate()[0]
print(output.decode())
```

# Using subprocess with `with` Statement

When dealing with resources, it's good practice to use context managers:

```python
with subprocess.Popen(["cat"], stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, text=True) as proc:
    output, _ = proc.communicate("Hello via cat")
    print(output)
```

# Summary

The `subprocess` module is a flexible and powerful way to work with system processes in Python. It should be preferred over older modules like `os.system` for improved security and control.

For more complex interactions, such as sending input or reading output line-by-line, `Popen` is the recommended interface.

**Note:** Always validate and sanitize any user inputs passed to subprocesses to avoid security risks such as shell injection.
