## 🚀 Introduction

This tutorial walks you through setting up a Python project using [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for dependency management and [`ruff`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and formatting, including integrating `ruff` with Git via a pre-commit hook.

By the end, you’ll have:
- A minimal Python project
- `uv` for fast, modern package management
- `ruff` configured for formatting, linting, and as a pre-commit hook

---

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (>=3.8)
- Git
- [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv): install with:

```bash
$ curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

---

## Project Structure

Let’s start by creating a new project:

```bash
$ uv init example-project
$ cd example-project
$ git init
$ tree -a -L1
.
├── .git
├── main.py
├── pyproject.toml
├── .python-version
└── README.md

2 directories, 4 files
```

---

## 📦 Step 1: Initialize the project with `uv`

```bash
$ uv venv         # Create a virtual environment
Using CPython 3.13.3 interpreter at: /usr/bin/python3.13
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate.fish
$ source .venv/bin/activate.fish # using fish shell
(example-project) $
```

Install some basic packages:

- [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/#install):

```bash
$ uv pip install pre-commit
```

```bash
$ uv pip install ruff
```

---

## 📝 Step 2: Adjust pyproject.toml

Here's an example `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project]
name = "my_project"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "An example project using uv and ruff"

[tool.ruff]
line-length = 88
target-version = "py311"
lint.select = ["E", "F", "I"]
lint.ignore = ["E501"]
```

---

## 🧪 Step 3: Add a sample script

Create `main.py`:

```python
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(greet("World"))
```

Run `ruff` to check the file:

```bash
ruff check .
```

Or automatically fix issues:

```bash
ruff check . --fix
```

---

## ✅ Step 4: Set up pre-commit hook for `ruff`

Create a `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
    rev: v0.4.0  # Replace with latest tag
    hooks:
      - id: ruff
```

Install the hook:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

Now `ruff` will run before every commit.

You can also test it manually:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

---

## 🌟 Best Practices

- **Use `pyproject.toml`** as the single config file for tools.
- **Keep dependencies pinned** with `uv` (via `requirements.txt` or `.lock` files).
- **Use `ruff` for linting and formatting** — it's fast and all-in-one.
- **Automate checks** via `pre-commit` and CI.

---

## 📚 Summary

We covered how to:

- Set up a Python project using `uv`
- Install and configure `ruff`
- Automate linting with pre-commit hooks

This gives you a solid base for any Python project with modern tooling.

Happy coding! 🚀
