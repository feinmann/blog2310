# Introduction to JJ Version Control

JJ is a Git-compatible version control system that aims to be more user-friendly and powerful than Git. In this tutorial, we'll explore the basic commands and workflows of JJ.

## Installation

JJ can be installed using Cargo (Rust's package manager). First, make sure you have Rust installed on your system. Then run:

```{bash}
cargo install jj-cli
```

If you don't have Rust installed, you can install it from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).

After installation, you might need to restart your terminal or add the Cargo binary directory to your PATH. The binary is typically installed at `~/.cargo/bin/jj`.

## Getting Started

Let's first check if JJ is installed and its version:

```{bash}
jj --version
```

## Basic Commands

Let's explore some basic JJ commands:

### Initializing a Repository

```{bash}
$ jj git init jj-tutorial
Initialized repo in "jj-tutorial"
```

### Checking Repository Status

```{bash}
jj status
```

### Making Changes

Let's create a simple file and commit it:

```{bash}
echo "Hello, JJ!" > hello.txt
jj add hello.txt
jj commit -m "Add hello.txt"
```

### Viewing History

```{bash}
jj log
```

## Working with Branches

Let's try some branch operations:

```{bash}
jj branch create feature-branch
jj branch list
```
